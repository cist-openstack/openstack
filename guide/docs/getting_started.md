### Let's Get Started!

First thing is first - you need a "project" set up. A project refers to a collection of compute resources set aside just for you. Resources are RAM, CPUs, disk space, IP addresses, networks, routers, volumes, object storage, SSH keys, and the maximum number of instances that you can make.

Student defaults:  
- 4GB RAM  
- 4 CPU  
- 200GB of disk  
- 4 Networks  
- 4 Routers  
- 4 Instances  

### How Do I Set Up a Project?

Please contact the CIST-OpenStack team at **cist.openstack@pitt.edu** to request a project be created for you. Please include your full name, your Pitt username, and your justification for compute resources. If the student defaults above are not enough to facilitate your needs, please explain why and what you need more of.  

### Can My Resources Be Combined to a Single Instance?

Sure, you can use your resources however you please. If you would like to create a single virtual machine that consumes all of your RAM, CPU, and disk, that is up to you. If you would like to create 4 small virtual machines you are free to do so as well. You may delete and recycle your resources as many times as you would like, but you will be unable to exceed your quota.

### How Do I Create an Instance?

Once your project has been created, follow the "Setting up Your Project" guide to get started.
